# YouTube Detoxify Contributor Guidelines

Welcome to YouTube Detoxify! We're excited to have you here. Whether you’re new to open-source or an experienced contributor, this guide will help you get started and make meaningful contributions.


## How to Contribute

1. **Fork the repository**  
   First, fork the repository to your GitHub account. This creates a copy of the project where you can work.

2. **Clone your fork locally**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Digital-Detox.git
   cd Digital-Detox
   ```

3. **Set up the project**  
   Install all necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Create a new branch**  
   Always work on a new branch when adding features or fixing bugs:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature-name
   ```

5. **Make your changes**  
   Add your code.

6. **Commit your changes**  
   Write clear, descriptive commit messages:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Added feature: description"
   ```

7. **Push your changes**  
   Push your branch to your forked repository:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature-name
   ```

8. **Create a Pull Request**  
   Once you're happy with your changes, create a Pull Request (PR) to merge your branch into the main project. Make sure your PR explains what the changes are and why they're necessary.
